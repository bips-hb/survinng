## Generate the Data

We consider a simulated dataset with the following characteristics:

- **Sample size:** 10,000 individuals  
  - 9,500 samples used for training  
  - 500 samples used for testing

- **Covariates:**
  - $X_1 \sim N(0, 1)$: has a **time-dependent effect** on the hazard:
    - Initially a **negative** effect
    - Later transitions to a **positive** effect  
    _(This implies the opposite effect on the survival probability)_
  
  - $X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$: has a **positive effect** on the hazard  
    → **Negative effect** on survival
  
  - $X_3 \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 1)$: has a **strong negative effect** on the hazard  
    → **Positive effect** on survival

  - $X_4 \sim \mathcal{U}(-1, 1)$: has **no effect** on the hazard or survival


## Load Models and Data

The models used in this vignette are the same as those used in the main paper. The models were trained using the `survivalmodels` package, and the training process is not shown here, but can be found in the `vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent` directory.

```{r td fit models, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}

# Load data
train <- readRDS(here("vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/train.rds"))
test <- readRDS(here("vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/test.rds"))
dat <- rbind(train, test)

# Load extracted models
ext_coxtime <- readRDS(here("vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/extracted_model_coxtime.rds"))
ext_deepsurv <- readRDS(here("vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/extracted_model_deepsurv.rds"))
ext_deephit <- readRDS(here("vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/extracted_model_deephit.rds"))
```


## Create Explainer

The `explain()` function creates an explainer object for the survival models. The `data` argument specifies the dataset used for explanation, and the `model` argument specifies the model to be explained. The `target` argument indicates the type of prediction to be explained (e.g., "survival", "risk", "cumulative hazard").

```{r td explainer}
exp_deephit <- Survinng::explain(ext_deephit[[1]], data = test)
exp_coxtime <- Survinng::explain(ext_coxtime[[1]], data = test)
exp_deepsurv <- Survinng::explain(ext_deepsurv[[1]], data = test)
```

## Performance

The performance of the models is evaluated using the C-Index and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). The C-Index measures the concordance between predicted and observed survival times, while the IBS quantifies the accuracy of survival predictions. 

|Model | C-Index | IBS
|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|CoxTime   | 0.845570   | 0.058430 |
|DeepSurv   | 0.859624   | 0.060411 |
|DeepHit   | 0.806480   | 0.095961 |

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('vignettes/articles/Sim_time_dependent/sim_td_brier_plot.png'))
```



## Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves

The Kaplan-Meier survival curves are plotted to visualize the survival probabilities over time. The `x1` variable is categorized into two groups (low and high) based on its median value. The survival curves are then plotted for each group.

```{r td KM, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Categorize `x1` into bins (e.g., low, medium, high)
dat$x1_group <- cut(dat$x1, 
                    breaks = quantile(dat$x1, probs = c(0, 0.5, 1)), 
                    labels = c("Low", "High"), 
                    include.lowest = TRUE)

# Create a Surv object
surv_obj <- Surv(dat$time, dat$status)

# Fit Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by `x1_group`
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ x1_group, data = dat)

# Plot the KM curves
km_plot <- ggsurvplot(km_fit, 
                      data = dat,
                      xlab = "Time t",
                      ylab = "Survival Probability",
                      legend.title = "x1 Group",
                      palette = c("#377EB8", "#E69F00"),  
                      title = "") 
km_plot$plot <- km_plot$plot + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 17) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  geom_rug(data = test, aes(x = time), sides = "bl", linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE)
km_plot
```

### Survival Prediction

The survival predictions for the test dataset are computed using the `predict()` function. The `type` argument specifies the type of prediction to be made (e.g., "survival", "risk", "cumulative hazard"). The survival predictions are then plotted for a set of instances of interest.

```{r td surv pred, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# Print instances of interest
td_ids <- c(79, 428)
print(test[td_ids, ])

# Compute Vanilla Gradient
grad_cox <- surv_grad(exp_coxtime, target = "survival", instance = td_ids)
grad_deephit <- surv_grad(exp_deephit, target = "survival", instance = td_ids)
grad_deepsurv <- surv_grad(exp_deepsurv, target = "survival", instance = td_ids)

# Plot survival predictions
surv_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_surv_pred(grad_cox) ,
  plot_surv_pred(grad_deephit),
  plot_surv_pred(grad_deepsurv),
  nrow = 1, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"),
  label_x = 0.03,      
  label_size = 14) 
surv_plot
```

## Explainable AI

The following sections demonstrate the application of various gradient-based explanation methods to the survival models. The methods include Grad(t), SmoothGrad(t), IntGrad(t), and GradSHAP(t), corresponding to the plots shown in the main body of the paper.

### Grad(t) (Sensitivity)

Here we compute the gradient of the survival predictions with respect to the input features. The `surv_grad()` function computes the gradients for the specified instances.

```{r td gradient, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot attributions
grad_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(grad_cox, label = "Grad(t)") ,
  plot_attribution(grad_deephit, label = "Grad(t)"),
  plot_attribution(grad_deepsurv, label = "Grad(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
grad_plot
```

### SmoothGrad(t) (Sensitivity)

SmoothGrad(t) is a method that adds noise to the input features and computes the average gradient over multiple noisy samples. This approach helps to reduce the noise in the gradient estimates and provides a clearer picture of the feature importance.

```{r td smoothgrad, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Compute SmoothGrad
sg_cox <- surv_smoothgrad(exp_coxtime, target = "survival", instance = td_ids, 
                          n = 50, noise_level = 0.1)
sg_deephit <- surv_smoothgrad(exp_deephit, target = "survival", instance = td_ids, 
                              n = 50, noise_level = 0.1)
sg_deepsurv <- surv_smoothgrad(exp_deepsurv, target = "survival", instance = td_ids, 
                               n = 50, noise_level = 0.1)

# Plot attributions
smoothgrad_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(sg_cox, label = "SG(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(sg_deephit, label = "SG(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(sg_deepsurv, label = "SG(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
smoothgrad_plot
```

The relevance curves derived from output-sensitive methods effectively reveal the time-dependent effect of $x_1$ on the survival predictions, by indicating a positive effect at earlier times and a negative effect later on. This time-dependent effect is accurately captured by CoxTime and DeepHit, but not by DeepSurv, which is inherently constrained by the PH assumption and thus unable to model time-dependence.

### IntGrad(t)

IntGrad(t) is a method that computes the integral of the gradients along a straight line path from a reference point to the input instance. This method provides a more comprehensive view of the feature importance by considering the cumulative effect of the features over time.

In addition to time-dependence in feature effects, difference-to-reference methods (i.e., IntGrad(t) and GradSHAP(t)) provide insights into the relative scale, direction, and magnitude of feature effects by comparing predictions to a meaningful reference.

#### Zero baseline (should be proportional to Gradient x I(t))

The zero baseline is a reference point where all features are set to zero.

```{r td intgrad0, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Compute IntegratedGradient with 0 baseline
x_ref <- matrix(c(0,0,0,0), nrow = 1)
ig0_cox <- surv_intgrad(exp_coxtime, instance = td_ids, n = 50, x_ref = x_ref)
ig0_deephit <- surv_intgrad(exp_deephit, instance = td_ids, n = 50, x_ref = x_ref)
ig0_deepsurv <- surv_intgrad(exp_deepsurv, instance = td_ids, n = 50, x_ref = x_ref)

# Plot attributions
intgrad0_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(ig0_cox, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(ig0_deephit, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(ig0_deepsurv, label = "IntGrad(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
intgrad0_plot
```

```{r td intgrad0 comp, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot attributions
intgrad0_plot_comp <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(ig0_cox, add_comp = TRUE, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(ig0_deephit, add_comp = TRUE, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(ig0_deepsurv, add_comp = TRUE, label = "IntGrad(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
intgrad0_plot_comp
```

\emph{Contribution plots} effectively visualize the normalized absolute contribution of each feature to the difference between reference and (survival) prediction over time. 

```{r td intgrad0 contr, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot contributions
intgrad0_plot_contr <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_contribution(ig0_cox, scale = 0.9, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_contribution(ig0_deephit, scale = 0.9, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_contribution(ig0_deepsurv, scale = 0.9, label = "IntGrad(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
intgrad0_plot_contr
```

Complementarily, \emph{force plots} emphasize the relative contribution and direction of each feature at a set of representative survival times.

```{r td intgrad0 force, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot force
intgrad0_plot_force <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_force(ig0_cox, zero_feature = "x4", upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, lower_distance_x1 = 0.05, intgrad0_td_cox = TRUE, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  plot_force(ig0_deephit, zero_feature = "x4", upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, lower_distance_x1 = 0.02, label = "IntGrad(t)"),  
  plot_force(ig0_deepsurv, zero_feature = "x4", upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, intgrad0_td_deepsurv = TRUE, label = "IntGrad(t)"), 
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
intgrad0_plot_force
```


### GradShap(t)

GradSHAP(t) is a method that computes the SHAP values for survival predictions. It provides a measure of the contribution of each feature to the survival predictions, taking into account the time-dependent effects.

```{r td gradshap, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Compute GradShap(t)
gshap_cox <- surv_gradSHAP(exp_coxtime, instance = td_ids, n = 50, num_samples = 100)
gshap_deephit <- surv_gradSHAP(exp_deephit, instance = td_ids, n = 50, num_samples = 100)
gshap_deepsurv <- surv_gradSHAP(exp_deepsurv, instance = td_ids, n = 50, num_samples = 100)

# Plot attributions
gshap_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(gshap_cox, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(gshap_deephit, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(gshap_deepsurv, label = "GradSHAP(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
gshap_plot
```



```{r td gradshap comp, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot attributions
gshap_plot_comp <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_attribution(gshap_cox, add_comp = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(gshap_deephit, add_comp = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_attribution(gshap_deepsurv, add_comp = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
gshap_plot_comp
```


```{r td gradshap contr, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot contributions
gshap_plot_contr <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_contribution(gshap_cox, scale = 0.9, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_contribution(gshap_deephit, scale = 0.9, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_contribution(gshap_deepsurv, scale = 0.9, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
gshap_plot_contr
```

```{r td gradshap force, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# Plot force
gshap_plot_force <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_force(gshap_cox, upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, zero_feature = "x4", gradshap_td_cox = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_force(gshap_deephit, upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, zero_feature = "x4", gradshap_td_deephit = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"), 
  plot_force(gshap_deepsurv, upper_distance = 0, lower_distance = 0, zero_feature = "x4", gradshap_td_deepsurv = TRUE, label = "GradSHAP(t)"),
  nrow = 3, labels = c("CoxTime", "DeepHit", "DeepSurv"))
gshap_plot_force
```

For example, the opposite effects of low vs. high values of $x_1$ are effectively captured in the plots. In observation 79, a low $x_1$ positively influences survival at later time points ($t>2$) compared to the overall average survival in the dataset, resulting in its largest contributions occurring at these times. Conversely, in observation 428, a high $x_1$ induces substantial contributions at earlier time points ($t<2$), but negatively impacts survival at later times, reflecting its early event as a consequence of the high $x_1$ and the strong negative effect of $x_3$. The average normalized absolute contribution, displayed on the right side of the contribution plots, offers a time-independent measure of feature importance, confirming the dominance of $x_3$ for the survival prediction of instance 428. Additionally, the visualizations suggest that CoxTime partially attributes the time-varying effect of $x_1$ to the other features, as the model, being non-parametric and lacking explicit knowledge of the time-dependent functional form, struggles to precisely disentangle and localize this effect.

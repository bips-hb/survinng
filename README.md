The package `survinng` provides gradient-based feature attribution methods 
for deep learning survival models. It implements novel adaptions of model-specific
XAI methods for the survival analysis domain, like **Grad(t)**, **SG(t)**, **GxI(t)**,
**IntGrad(t)**, and **GradSHAP(t)**. The whole package is designed to be compatible with the
[`survivalmodels`](https://github.com/RaphaelS1/survivalmodels) package in R, 
which is an R wrapper for the [`pycox`](https://github.com/havakv/pycox) Python package.
However, it can also be used with models from `pycox` directly and other 
survival models loaded in `torch`. Currently, the package supports the models
types `DeepSurv`/`CoxPH`, `DeepHit`, and `CoxTime`.

### 🚀 Why `survinng`?

With `survinng`, you get:

* ⏱ **Model-specific** and **time-resolved** feature attributions for individuals  
* ⚡️ **Fast and scalable** explanations using model gradients, especially for SHAP-like explanations  
* 🤝 Compatible with `survivalmodels` and `pycox` models  
* 📊 Easy-to-use **visualization tools** for temporal insights  
* 🔀 Support for **multimodal** inputs (e.g., tabular + image)  


Overall, this package is part of the following ICML'25 paper:

## 📦 Installation

To install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bips-hb/survinng")
```

## 📖 Usage

You have a trained survival neural network model from `survivalmodels` or
`pycox` and your model input data data. Now you want to interpret individual 
data points by using the methods from the package `survinng`, then stick to the 
following pseudo code:

```r
library(survinng)

# Load a survival model and corresponding data
model <- ... (e.g., from survivalmodels or pycox)
data <- ... (e.g., the test set of the model)

# Create explainer object
explainer <- survinng::explain(model, data)

# Compute feature attributions
idx <- 1 # index of the instance to explain
grad <- surv_grad(explainer, instance = idx) # Grad(t)
sg <- surv_smoothgrad(explainer, instance = idx) # SG(t)
gxi <- surv_grad(explainer, instance = idx, times_input = TRUE) # GxI(t)
ig <- surv_intgrad(explainer, instance = idx) # IntGrad(t)
shap <- surv_gradSHAP(explainer, instance = idx) # GradSHAP(t)

# Plot results
plot(shap)
```

## 💻 Quick Example

```r
library(survival)
library(callr)

# Load lung dataset
data(cancer, package="survival")
data <- na.omit(cancer[, c(1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 2, 3)])
train <- data[1:150, ]
test <- data[151:212, ]

# Train a DeepSurv model
ext <- callr::r(function(train) {
  library(survivalmodels)
  library(survival)
  
  # Fit the DeepSurv model
  install_pycox(install_torch = TRUE) # Requires pycox
  fit <- deepsurv(Surv(time, status) ~ ., data = train, epochs = 100,
                  early_stopping = TRUE)

  # Extract the model
  survinng::extract_model(fit)
}, args = list(train = train))


# Create explainer
explainer <- explain(ext, data = test)

# Run GradSHAP(t)
shap <- surv_gradSHAP(explainer)

# Plot results
plot(shap)
```
